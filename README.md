# Desupload

This is a website exclusively for designers. They'll upload their work here, and potential clients can discover and collaborate with them.

This website is a mix of Instagram and Pinterest — users can upload pictures into boards (like Pinterest), and display them as posts (like Instagram). It's essentially a LinkedIn-style platform, but only for designers.

This platform needs a backend to store data — for now, I've created the frontend using HTML.

This platform will definitely be helpful for designers to interact and grow business opportunities quickly and easily.

I hope my idea is considered.  
**Thank you.**
